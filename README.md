# Gallows
An implementation of the pen-and-paper game 'Hangman' in C++

# Notice
Gallows was developed using the Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition 2017 IDE, for the associated compiler. You may have to do
some leg work when it comes to compiling the game with other tools, such as GCC.

# Installation
Clone the repository, or download the zip file and extract the compiled game to a suitable location to your computer. Ensure that the 'Data' folder is directly adjacent to the executable file and run it. If you want to be able to play **Gallows** from any location within the command prompt - or through the run command - be sure to add it to your system path.

# How to Play
**Gallows** is best played directly from the command prompt in Windows.

The game will give you a random word, showing only the number of letters it contains. Your challenge is to guess that word one character at a time. Guess incorrectly, and you tiptoe ever closer to your demise. You cannot guess the same letter multiple times, once a letter is guessed correctly, all instances of that letter will be shown.

Be warned that you will guess a letter as soon as you press the key. There's no going back...
